def plotData(x, y):
    """
    Plots the data points x and y into a new figure. Plots the data 
    points and gives the figure axes labels of population and profit.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Data point values for x-axis.

    y : array_like
        Data point values for y-axis. Note x and y should have the same size.
    
    Instructions
    ------------
    Plot the training data into a figure using the "figure" and "plot"
    functions. Set the axes labels using the "xlabel" and "ylabel" functions.
    Assume the population and revenue data have been passed in as the x
    and y arguments of this function.    
    
    Hint
    ----
    You can use the 'ro' option with plot to have the markers
    appear as red circles. Furthermore, you can make the markers larger by
    using plot(..., 'ro', ms=10), where `ms` refers to marker size. You 
    can also set the marker edge color using the `mec` property.

def computeCost(X, y, theta):
    """
    Compute cost for linear regression. Computes the cost of using theta as the
    parameter for linear regression to fit the data points in X and y.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array_like
        The input dataset of shape (m x n+1), where m is the number of examples,
        and n is the number of features. We assume a vector of one's already 
        appended to the features so we have n+1 columns.
    
    y : array_like
        The values of the function at each data point. This is a vector of
        shape (m, ).
    
    theta : array_like
        The parameters for the regression function. This is a vector of 
        shape (n+1, ).
    
    Returns
    -------
    J : float
        The value of the regression cost function.
    
    Instructions
    ------------
    Compute the cost of a particular choice of theta. 
    You should set J to the cost.
