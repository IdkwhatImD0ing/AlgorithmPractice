# Calculating Trig Equations
This program calculates arcSin, arcCos, arcTan, and Log for a certain value. It tests arcSin and arcCos from -1 to 1, and Log and arcTan from 1 to 10.

## Build
make all

## Running
./mathlib-test
-a for all tests
-s for arcSin tests
-c for arcCos tests
-t for arcTan tests
-l for Log tests
